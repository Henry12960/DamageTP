## 📫 • General:

 - Plugin Introduction: 

   > This is a simple plugin that teleports the player to the world spawn receiving different types of damage like void, this ends up becoming useful for many people who want to moderate and avoid damage from players on their servers, you can also define the worlds in which want this function to work, if you need more damage support just create an issue on my github! Hope you like it.
